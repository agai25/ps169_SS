            <h2>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</h2>
            <p>
                In the summer of 1787, a special meeting called the Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fifty-five men from twelve states (Rhode Island didn't send anyone) came together to create a new plan for America's government. They met in the Pennsylvania State House, which is now called Independence Hall - the same building where the Declaration of Independence was signed eleven years earlier.

            <!-- The People Who Wrote the Constitution -->
            <h2>THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION</h2>
            <p>
                The men who wrote the Constitution were called the Framers. Some important Framers were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>George Washington from Virginia, who led the meeting</li>
                <li>James Madison from Virginia, who took detailed notes and suggested many ideas</li>
                <li>Benjamin Franklin from Pennsylvania, who was the oldest person there at 81 years old</li>
                <li>Alexander Hamilton from New York, who wanted a strong national government</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These men were lawyers, farmers, merchants, and leaders in their communities. They were well-educated and wanted to create a better government for the new nation.

            <!-- Why They Needed a New Plan -->
            <h2>WHY THEY NEEDED A NEW PLAN</h2>
            <p>
                Before the Constitution, America had a different set of rules called the Articles of Confederation. This plan wasn't working well because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The national government was too weak</li>
                <li>It couldn't collect taxes to pay its bills</li>
                <li>It couldn't solve problems between states</li>
                <li>It couldn't protect American trade with other countries</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT</h2>
            <p>
                The Framers didn't always agree on how the new government should work. They had big disagreements about:

            <h3>Size of Government</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Some people, like Alexander Hamilton, wanted a strong federal (national) government</li>
                <li>Others, like George Mason, worried that a strong federal government might take away states' rights and individual freedoms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Representation in Congress</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large states wanted representation based on population (more people = more votes)</li>
                <li>Small states wanted equal representation (each state gets the same number of votes)</li>
                <li>They solved this with the Great Compromise: two parts of Congress - the House of Representatives (based on population) and the Senate (two senators per state)</li>

            <h3>Slavery</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Northern states wanted to count only free people for representation</li>
                <li>Southern states wanted to count enslaved people too</li>
                <li>They made the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted each enslaved person as three-fifths of a person for representation (this unfair rule was later changed after the Civil War)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Finishing the Constitution -->
            <h2>FINISHING THE CONSTITUTION</h2>
            <p>
                After four months of debates and compromises, the Framers finished writing the Constitution on September 17, 1787. Thirty-nine of the Framers signed it. Then it had to be approved by at least nine states before it could become the law of the land.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Constitution created our system of government with three branches - legislative, executive, and judicial - and a system of checks and balances to make sure no part of the government became too powerful.
